  * Allow a timeout value to be set in the internal http client.
  * Fixed up the subclass constructors of the Client class to pass in
    kwargs instead of explicitly defining them
  * Not sure why self.headers was changed to None. I believe there was a
    merge conflict that I missed.

  [ caseycrites ]
  * Added self.req_headers and self.res_headers so that people can set
    headers on requests.
  * Re-added self.headers in a way so that it mirrors self.res_headers.
    Also added a deprecation warning to get_most_recent_http_headers.
  * Removed res_headers since keeping it and headers synced up was a
    pain in the ass that wasn't worth it. Also, reintroduced the local
    headers var in _request and updated it with self.req_headers so
    there's no leaking of header values.
  * Fixed the deprecation warning message to use implicit string
    concatenation to eliminate whitespace.

    creating an instance of the Layer object so that
    client.storage.update_layer() works.

  * Revert "s/twisted/twistd/" This reverts commit
    ca0bba35498bb5b36b0fcae50aa322727ec8b9c3.
  * Added a test for tag filtering on nearby queries.
  * Use assertEquals for better failure messages
  * Removed 'type' as a required property of a Record.
  * We no longer need to assert that a Record's type is defined with the
    user-defined properties.

    when the object is decoded from a dict.

  [ Zooko ]
  * trying to repair the hudson config for building this project,
    changing something just to trigger a new build

  [ Ben Standefer ]
  * Made backwards compatible. Still need to fix tests. WTF.
  * Fixed tests.
  * Add imports for backwards compatibility.
  * Don't run pyflakes since we need unused imports to support BC.
  * Disable pyflakes the right way.
  * Remove namespace stuff, it's messing up the resulting .debs.
  * Try removing namespace_packages from setup.py.
  * Specify python-oauth2 as a run-time dependency in debian/control.
  * Added more explicit run-time dependencies.  It looks like the
    python:Depends variable in debian/control should do this, but might
    not be working?
  * Continue to provide/accept the API_VERSION variable.  Even though it
    doesn't impact the request URLs right now, it may down the road.
  * Add Provides/Replaces/Conflicts logic to replace old Debian
    packages.
  * Oh yeah, blank lines mean stuff in debian/control.
  * Add backwards compatibility with simplegeo.shared.
  * simplegeo/__init__.py
  * Fix BC imports, whoops.
  * More fanciful backwards compatiblity for the old Storage client. Ian
    E.: To BC, or not to BC, that is the question: Whether â€™tis nobler
    in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outraged developers,
    or to take arms against a sea of code, and by opposing end them? To
    exit(): to sleep().
  * Update comment on layer management being pre-release.

  [ dsmith ]
  * Put the HTTP parameter logic into a single place instead of doing it
    in URI string formations for each client.
  * Define body first.

  [ Ben Standefer ]
  * Only append parameters to GET requests if the data dict is
    populated. Fix tests to support new way.
  * Fix consumption tests.
  * Cleanup old stuff after merging new client code. No more Twisted, no
    redundant README, test_client has been copied (not via git) to the
    consumption/ directory, move test_record to simplegeo/test/models.
